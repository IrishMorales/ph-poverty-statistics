### ðŸ”¶ Data Sources
- **1991-2015 Data** - Provided by Thinking Machines
- **FIES 2018 & 2021 Data** - "2021 Full Year Official Poverty Statistics Tables" from https://psa.gov.ph/poverty-press-releases/nid/167972
Unfortunately, the 2021 data here is from the preliminary 2021 FIES results, as I could not find a full and official release of the finalized 2021 data with these variables. I then created the .csv files manually to match the formatting of this dataset. For easy viewing, I copied the original attachment data [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vS7aF0Vl632l7dWEUgs5GxfWZsmMmvFY/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100450481071067541565&rtpof=true&sd=true). I then cleaned and reformatted the 2018 & 2021 data [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GCU--tzB7GWSx1Uk7ddlA7EsoQ6rNp91_UUDbleZ0nI/edit?usp=sharing). The final processed .csv files are in this GitHub repo ([2018](https://github.com/IrishMorales/ph-poverty-statistics/blob/b94819039b8f141cd2bfc3b667d748418cfb5f2a/2018_FIES_processed.csv), [2021](https://github.com/IrishMorales/ph-poverty-statistics/blob/master/2021_FIES_processed.csv)).
- **2024 & 2027 Data** - Personally forecasted using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). Process and full details seen in the [.ipynb file](https://github.com/IrishMorales/ph-poverty-statistics/blob/b94819039b8f141cd2bfc3b667d748418cfb5f2a/ph-poverty-statistics.ipynb). *Caveats:* Forecasts are likely not very accurate due to very few data points for the model to train on and data may be slightly skewed due to the 2021 pandemic. Overall, however, the forecast can at least give us at least some general idea of developments in poverty for the coming years.
